This work is supported by Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy, under Contract DE-AC02-06CH11357, program manager Laura Biven. We gratefully acknowledge the computing resources provided on the Theta supercomputer operated by Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported under Contract DE-AC02-06CH11357, which was used to generate all the strong and weak scaling results. This research also used resources in the Bebop, a high-performance computing cluster operated by the Laboratory Computing Resource Center (LCRC) at Argonne National Laboratory to test and optimize performance of the drivers at scale.
